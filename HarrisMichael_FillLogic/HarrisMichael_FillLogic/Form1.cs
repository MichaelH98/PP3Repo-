            - You must change the project name to conform to the required
              naming convention.
            - You must comment the code throughout.  Failure to do so could result
              in a lower grade.
            - All button names and other provided variables and controls must
              remain the same.  Changing these could result in a 0 on the project.
            - Selecting Blue or Red on the View menu should change the imageList
              attached to all buttons so that any current play will change the color
              of all button images.
            - Saved games should save to XML.  A game should load only from XML and
              should not crash the application if a user tries to load an incorrect 
              file.
